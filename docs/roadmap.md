# Roadmap

## Phase 1 — Canonical Foundation (Complete)

- Establish the full SUBIT‑morph pipeline: 6‑bit windows, 64‑state distribution, 8×8 grid, cube embedding  
- Implement reference‑grade code: `subit.py`, `metrics.py`, `grid.py`, `utils.py`  
- Document the algorithm in pseudocode and narrative form  
- Provide domain examples and comparative morphology  
- Define morphological space and the SUBIT‑address  
- Produce interpretability notes, theory, glossary, and applications  

This phase delivers a complete, minimal, canonical specification of the system.

---

## Phase 2 — Repository Consolidation (In Progress)

- Organize all Markdown documents into a coherent structure  
- Ensure consistent terminology across files  
- Add cross‑references between theory, examples, and code  
- Prepare a clean top‑level README with conceptual and practical entry points  
- Validate that all metrics and definitions match the canonical SUBIT‑64 architecture  

The goal is a polished, research‑ready repository.

---

## Phase 3 — Tooling and Developer Experience

- Add command‑line utilities for computing morphs on arbitrary files  
- Provide a minimal Python API for integration into other systems  
- Add formatting helpers for grids, vectors, and SUBIT‑addresses  
- Create example notebooks demonstrating analysis workflows  
- Add tests for entropy, anisotropy, tension, and grid construction  

This phase makes SUBIT‑morph easy to use, extend, and embed.

---

## Phase 4 — Morphological Atlas

- Generate a curated set of canonical morphs across domains  
- Map their positions in morphological space  
- Provide narrative descriptions of domain signatures  
- Include visualizations of clusters and trajectories  
- Add comparative tables and interpretive commentary  

The atlas becomes a reference for understanding informational form.

---

## Phase 5 — Advanced Analysis Layer

- Introduce distance metrics in morphological space  
- Add clustering and classification utilities  
- Provide anomaly‑detection examples  
- Explore temporal morph trajectories for streaming data  
- Add style and authorship case studies  

This phase extends SUBIT‑morph into a full analytical framework.

---

## Phase 6 — SUBIT‑64 Integration

- Align all terminology with the SUBIT‑64 semantic canon  
- Map morphological states to SUBIT‑crystal trigrams where appropriate  
- Provide a unified conceptual layer connecting morphology and semantics  
- Add documentation showing how SUBIT‑morph fits into the broader architecture  

This phase unifies the morphological and semantic layers.

---

## Phase 7 — Publication and Release

- Finalize repository structure for public release  
- Prepare a canonical README, overview, and installation guide  
- Add a concise whitepaper summarizing theory and applications  
- Provide a minimal example dataset and usage instructions  
- Tag version 1.0.0 as the stable reference implementation  

This phase makes SUBIT‑morph ready for external adoption.

---

## Phase 8 — Future Directions

- Explore higher‑order windows (7‑bit, 8‑bit) for extended morphology  
- Investigate multi‑scale morphs combining different window sizes  
- Add support for streaming and real‑time morph computation  
- Integrate with model‑monitoring pipelines  
- Develop visualization tools for interactive morphological space  

These directions expand the system while preserving canonical minimalism.
