# Example Morphs

## Overview

This document presents several illustrative SUBIT‑morphs computed from diverse data sources. Each example demonstrates how different informational flows produce distinct 64‑state distributions, 8×8 grids, and SUBIT‑addresses. The goal is to show how morphology varies across domains such as mathematics, biology, programming, natural language, and model‑generated text.

## π (Pi)

A mathematical constant produces a highly irregular but statistically stable byte‑level structure.  
Its SUBIT‑morph typically shows:

- high entropy  
- low anisotropy  
- moderate tension  

Characteristics:

- digits are uniformly distributed  
- no semantic structure  
- morphology reflects numerical randomness rather than meaning  

---

## DNA Sequence

A DNA stream encoded as ASCII characters (A, C, G, T) produces a distinctive morphological signature:

- lower entropy than π  
- strong anisotropy due to limited alphabet  
- characteristic tension from repeated motifs  

DNA morphology reflects:

- biological repetition  
- codon‑like patterns  
- constrained symbol set  

---

## Source Code

Programming languages exhibit:

- medium entropy  
- strong anisotropy  
- high tension from indentation, braces, keywords, and structure  

Code morphology is shaped by:

- syntax regularity  
- repeated tokens  
- predictable formatting patterns  

---

## Natural Language

Human writing produces:

- medium‑high entropy  
- moderate anisotropy  
- smooth tension  

Natural language morphology reflects:

- spacing  
- punctuation  
- stylistic habits  
- character frequency distributions  

Even without semantics, the byte‑level form is highly characteristic.

## Model‑Generated Text

Model outputs typically show:

- entropy similar to natural language  
- anisotropy patterns distinct from human writing  
- tension influenced by tokenization artifacts  

Model morphology reveals:

- statistical regularities of the model  
- characteristic repetition patterns  
- subtle structural biases

## Comparative Summary

| Domain              | Entropy | Anisotropy | Tension | Notes |
|---------------------|---------|------------|---------|-------|
| π                   | High    | Low        | Medium  | Numerical randomness |
| DNA                 | Low     | High       | Medium  | Limited alphabet, repeated motifs |
| Source Code         | Medium  | High       | High    | Strong structural patterns |
| Natural Language    | Medium‑High | Medium | Medium  | Human stylistic structure |
| Model Output        | Medium‑High | Medium‑High | Medium | Model‑specific morphology |

## Interpretation

These examples demonstrate that SUBIT‑morphs capture the *form* of information, not its meaning.  
Different domains produce distinct morphological identities, enabling:

- clustering  
- comparison  
- anomaly detection  
- style analysis  
- model interpretability  

The examples in this directory serve as reference points for understanding morphological diversity across informational flows.
