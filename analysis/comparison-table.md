# Comparison Table

## Overview

This table compares morphological characteristics across several domains using the SUBIT‑morph framework. Each domain produces a distinct 64‑state distribution and SUBIT‑address, revealing differences in randomness, directional structure, and radial distribution.

## Comparative Morphology

| Domain              | Entropy (E) | Anisotropy (A) | Tension (T) | Morphological Notes |
|---------------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|----------------------|
| π (Pi)              | High        | Low             | Medium      | Numerical randomness; uniform digit distribution |
| DNA Sequence        | Low         | High            | Medium      | Limited alphabet; repeated motifs; strong structural bias |
| Source Code         | Medium      | High            | High        | Syntax regularity; indentation; predictable token patterns |
| Natural Language    | Medium‑High | Medium          | Medium      | Human stylistic structure; spacing and punctuation patterns |
| Model Output        | Medium‑High | Medium‑High     | Medium      | Tokenization artifacts; model‑specific structural tendencies |

## Interpretation

- High entropy domains (e.g., π) exhibit near‑uniform distributions with minimal directional bias.  
- Low entropy domains (e.g., DNA) show strong structural constraints and anisotropy.  
- Code and model outputs display elevated tension due to concentrated or polarized distribution patterns.  
- Natural language occupies a balanced region with moderate structure and variability.

This comparison highlights how SUBIT‑morphs capture the form of information independently of its meaning.
