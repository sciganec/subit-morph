# Interpretability Notes

## Purpose

These notes outline how SUBIT‑morphs contribute to interpretability by exposing structural properties of informational flows. The approach focuses on byte‑level morphology rather than semantics, enabling analysis of systems, models, and data streams through their intrinsic form.

---

## Structural Transparency

SUBIT‑morphs reveal patterns that are invisible at the semantic level:

- repetition and periodicity  
- directional biases  
- structural motifs  
- distributional irregularities  
- formatting and encoding artifacts  

These patterns help identify how information is shaped before meaning is considered.

---

## Model Behavior

Model‑generated text exhibits characteristic morphological signatures:

- stable entropy ranges  
- anisotropy influenced by tokenization  
- tension shaped by model‑specific repetition patterns  

Comparing human and model outputs in morphological space highlights differences in structure independent of content.

---

## Anomaly Detection

Morphological deviations can indicate:

- corrupted data  
- unexpected formatting  
- adversarial perturbations  
- distribution shifts  
- model drift  

Because SUBIT‑morphs operate at the byte level, they detect anomalies even when semantics appear normal.

---

## Style and Authorship

Different authors or systems produce distinct morphological profiles due to:

- punctuation habits  
- spacing patterns  
- character frequency distributions  
- structural regularities  

These differences appear clearly in the 64‑state grid and SUBIT‑address.

---

## Cross‑Domain Comparison

Morphology enables comparison across domains that are semantically unrelated:

- code vs. natural language  
- DNA vs. numerical data  
- human vs. model text  

The comparison is based purely on form, revealing deep structural similarities or differences.

---

## Interpretability Layer

SUBIT‑morphs provide an interpretability layer that is:

- model‑agnostic  
- content‑agnostic  
- encoding‑agnostic  
- stable across architectures  

This layer complements semantic and statistical methods by focusing on the geometry of information itself.

---

## Summary

Interpretability emerges from understanding how information is shaped. SUBIT‑morphs expose this shape through entropy, anisotropy, and tension, offering a universal framework for analyzing the structure of informational flows.
