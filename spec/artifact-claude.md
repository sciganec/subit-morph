# Claude Artifact

## Description

This artifact is an interactive, narrative‑style presentation created using Claude’s artifact system. It documents the conceptual development of SUBIT‑morphs, including the motivation for 6‑bit windows, the emergence of the 64‑state structure, and the early demonstrations of morphological analysis. The artifact serves as a historical and explanatory layer complementing the formal specification.

## Purpose

- Illustrates the reasoning process behind SUBIT‑morphs  
- Demonstrates how morphological grids and distributions were first explored  
- Provides an accessible, visual introduction to the core ideas  
- Acts as a companion to the technical specification and code  

## Contents

The artifact includes:

- conceptual explanations  
- visual demonstrations of 64‑state patterns  
- examples of morphological grids  
- narrative commentary on the design choices  
- early prototypes of SUBIT‑based analysis  

## File

The full HTML artifact is included in the `/artifacts` directory as:

```
claude-subit-morphs.html
```

This file can be opened in any modern browser and functions as a standalone interactive document.

## Status

The artifact is preserved as part of the SUBIT‑morphs release to document the origin and evolution of the system. It is not required for computation or implementation but provides valuable context for researchers and readers exploring the conceptual foundations.
